### Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on the flower's physical features like sepal and petal dimensions. It's a beginner-friendly machine learning project that covers data analysis, model training, and evaluation. The project was built entirely using Jupyter Notebook.

### Data Sources
Iris Flower Dataset: The dataset typically used for this project is the "iris_flower_dataset.csv" file, containing a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species) from Kaggle.
